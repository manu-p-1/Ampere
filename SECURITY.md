# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the Ampere Package/Release:

| Ampere Version | Supported Versions          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities as an Ampere issue or Discussion item. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

**Ampere does not have a dedicated security team or email address now, but plans to establish a dedicated communciations
pipeline after the 1.0.0 release.**
