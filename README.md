## Introduction
Ampere is a robust .NET utility library written in C#. It's main purpose is to make development more productive and easier. The Ampere docs can be found at [Ampere Docs](https://manu-p-1.github.io/Ampere/>).
## Execution
### Add the dependency to your project with NuGet
You can install the latest release with NuGet by clicking `Managing NuGet Packages...` under your Visual Studio project name. Browse for the project by typing `Ampere`, view the information, and choose the version you would like to install.

### Install from GitHub Packages
The latest NuGet release can be found under the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/manu-p-1/Ampere/packages/). You can use the instructions to install from the command line. 

## Contributing
We are actively looking for contributors to work on all aspects of the code base ― from documentation to building a variety of utilities. For more information on how to contribute, view our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/manu-p-1/Ampere/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Building Ampere
Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2017 or Later OR VSCode
- .NET 5 (with .NET Core)

The default language setting for this project is C# 9.0. The project can be built using `dotnet build` and the output will display the `AssemblyPath`.

### Documentation
There are two components to Ampere documentation:

1. Assembly Documentation
3. Miscellaneous Documentation (README.md, Wiki's, Discussions, etc...)

All Ampere methods are documented using .NET XML documentation. This is compiled using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) with the `docfx.json` file under the [DocFX folder](https://github.com/manu-p-1/Ampere/tree/master/DocFx). DocFX creates static
HTML pages which are used by [Ampere Docs](https://manu-p-1.github.io/Ampere/>). Lastly, as a fluid repository, many files change and constantly need to be documented and updated.

## Roadmap
There are two planned releases - the latest being by **July 2021**:

- 0.1.0 - First full release of Ampere
- 0.2.0 - Additional statistics data analysis tools.

## State
Ampere is a very fluid project and you may encounter issues during execution, especially for preleases. To report an issue visit, [Ampere Issues](https://github.com/manu-p-1/Ampere/issues), or to contribute, view the contribution guidelines.

## Licensing
Ampere is licensed under the [**GNU General Public License v3.0**](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.
